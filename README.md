# Instagram-Utilities
Python scripts that make my life easier on instagram.

### Backopy Meme Uploader
Automated meme page. Needs a folder to store memes, with 3 subfolders: CB, BB, WB
  CB: Sets the background to the same image but blurred
  WB: Sets the background to white
  BB: Sets the background to black
It resizes the images in case they are not squared and gives them a background depending on which folder the meme is in.
Must have another python script in the same folder with the name backopyConfig.py with the following:
USERNAME = "user_name"
PASSWORD = "password"

**Feel free to adapt this script to automate your own page.**
